                'long_description' => '<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressively reduces kidney function and, if undiagnosed, can lead to severe health complications or kidney failure. An early diagnosis using machine learning (ML) techniques can offer an efficient, non-invasive, and accurate solution. However, the effectiveness of ML largely depends on selecting and optimizing the right feature set. This research investigates multiple feature optimization approaches, combined with a max-voting ensemble model, to develop a highly accurate CKD diagnosis system.</p><p>The proposed ensemble model incorporates five widely used classifiers. Three types of feature optimization techniques are analyzed: feature importance, feature reduction, and feature selection. For each type, two leading techniques are examined in conjunction with the ensemble model. Among these, <strong>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</strong> — a feature selection method — achieved the highest performance, reaching <strong>99.5% accuracy</strong> using 10-fold cross-validation. This study confirms that effective feature optimization significantly enhances the performance of ML-based CKD diagnosis systems.</p><h2><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious medical condition that gradually impairs kidney function and may lead to total kidney failure. Various risk factors contribute to CKD, including high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, age, and family history of kidney disorders. Secondary factors such as obesity, autoimmune diseases, systemic infections, urinary tract infections, and kidney damage also contribute to its onset.</p><p>Treatment for CKD varies based on the stage and condition of the patient. Common treatments include lifestyle modification, medication to control underlying issues, dialysis, and, in advanced cases, kidney transplantation. According to a 2021 report, approximately <strong>37 million people in the United States</strong> alone are affected by CKD, while <strong>10% of the global population</strong> is estimated to suffer from it. CKD accounts for <strong>around 2.4 million deaths annually</strong> worldwide.</p><p>Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as blood and urine tests, require manual intervention by medical professionals. In recent years, the integration of <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>machine learning (ML)</strong> has opened new avenues for automated CKD diagnosis systems.</p><h3>1.1 Related Work</h3><p>Several studies have explored ML-based approaches for CKD diagnosis:</p><ol><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Polat, Mehr, and Cetin (2017)</strong> used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with filter and wrapper feature selection techniques, achieving a maximum accuracy of <strong>98.5%</strong>.</li><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Ghosh et al.

However, comprehensive comparisons of different feature optimization methods are limited.</p><h3>1.3 Research Contribution</h3><p>This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating various feature optimization techniques — categorized into <strong>feature importance</strong>, <strong>feature reduction</strong>, and <strong>feature selection</strong> — alongside a max-voting ensemble classifier. The objective is to identify the optimal technique that yields the highest diagnostic accuracy for CKD.</p>',

This paper focuses on the application of <strong>ensemble learning methods</strong> for effective classification of EEG signals.

The liberalization of electric markets has led to the unbundling of large utilities into separate generation, transmission, and distribution companies, resulting in significant changes to power system operating conditions. Many power system failures stem from unfavorable dynamic responses following disturbances. Moreover, environmental and economic factors are pushing power systems to operate closer to their stability limits, making dynamic security assessment increasingly critical.</p><p>Voltage collapse is a major form of instability that occurs when systems are heavily loaded. It arises due to load responses to voltage changes, which in turn cause further voltage fluctuations. This project develops indicators based on generator-load mismatch and active/reactive power margins for online assessment of proximity to voltage instability. The approach utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as function approximators to effectively model complex, nonlinear, and large-scale power system dynamics, which are difficult to address using traditional analytical methods.</p><p>The project also discusses the hierarchical control structure in power systems, including system controllers, plant controllers, and supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Additionally, it explores load data analysis and forecasting techniques, incorporating self-organizing features to classify load patterns by season, weekdays, and holidays. Finally, the importance of spinning and operating reserves in maintaining system adequacy is highlighted.</p><h3><strong>Keywords:</strong></h3><p>Voltage Stability, Neural Networks, Deregulated Market, Power System Control, Dynamic Security Assessment, Load Forecasting, Spinning Reserve</p>',
